When your vehicle navigates a turn, the inside wheel turns slower than the outside wheel, which has to turn faster in order to keep pace with the inside wheel.

Four wheel drive vehicles are equipped with a differential in front and back, while rear wheel drive vehicles are equipped with a differential in back. A front wheel drive’s differential, called the transaxle because of the functional combination of the front axle and transmission, is located between the front wheels. All-wheel drive vehicles are equipped with a differential between both the front and rear wheels with a transfer case between them.

    "innerHTML": " <div class=\"ndcustomcolorclass ServiceCenterFloater\"></div><p>Your car, truck, or SUV benefits from regular tire rotations because it aids in a smooth, comfortable, and safe driving experience. Tire rotation is done by changing the positions of your tires so the front tires may go to the rear, and the rear tires may go to the front. Your vehicle has a suggested tire rotation pattern, which may include the spare tire or swapping left and right. To help your tires last as long as possible, tire rotation and tire balancing are recommended <em>every 4,000 to 6,000 miles</em>.</p>\n<h3>How is Tire Rotation Performed</h3>\n<p>During the tire rotation process, the tires are moved from one position on a vehicle to another, which is done to prevent uneven wear and support tire longevity. When performing a tire rotation our technicians will:\n</p><li>\nRotate tires in alternating patterns</li>\n<li>\nExamine the overall quality and safety of tires</li>\n<li>\nCheck tire tread</li>\n<li>\nCheck for correct inflation</li>\n<li>\nSecure lug nuts</li>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Importance of Tire Rotation Service</h3>\n<p>Regular tire rotations will improve tire performance, extend the life of your tires, and in turn save you money. Your tires are the only part of your vehicle that touches the road, so it is important to look after them. Each of the tires on your vehicle experiences tread wear differently due to axle weight, cornering forces, and vehicle alignment. The front tires wear faster than the rear tires because they carry more weight, are the power wheels, and endure steering resistance, whereas the rear tires are free rolling. Moving each tire to different corners of your vehicle helps promote uniform tread wear.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of Getting Tire Rotations</h3>\n<p>Some other benefits of getting your tires rotated regularly are:\n</p><li>\nMaintains Traction&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\nPrevents Blowouts&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\nImproves Performance</li>\n<li>\nMaximizes Efficiency&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\nProlong Tire Life&nbsp;</li>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Signs You Need Tire Rotation Service</h3>\n<p>\n</p><li>\nUneven Wear</li>\n<li>\nVibration</li>\n<li>\nLosing Air Pressure</li>\n<li>\nPoor Gas Mileage</li>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Fred's Brake and Alignment&nbsp; Offers Tire Rotations in La Crosse, WI</h2>\n<p>If your tires show signs of irregular or uneven tread wear, we'll come to you and have one of our service technicians locate the cause of the wear problem.
